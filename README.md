# DigitalTwin-UserWalk-Simulation
Digital Twins are transforming wireless network planning. By modeling foliage, buildings, and street furniture from aerial and street-view imagery, planners can simulate coverage, optimize node placement, and balance cost before deployment.

# 🌐 Digital Twins for Smarter Wireless Network Planning 🌐
In my recent work, I’ve been exploring how Digital Twin representations of foliage, buildings, and street furniture—built using aerial and street-view imagery—can transform the deployment of mmWave, 5G, and future 6G networks.
## By integrating these Digital Twins into ray-tracing analyzers, network planners can:
### ✅ Identify optimal node placements.
### ✅ Estimate the number of nodes needed for reliable coverage.
### ✅ Visualize user connectivity and handovers.
### ✅ Balance performance with deployment cost before rollout.

## 📊 In a simulation for a region in Philadelphia, Digital Twins helped determine ~20 node placements. A subset demo (5–6 nodes) showed how users seamlessly connect and hand over between nodes as they move, giving planners real-time insights into coverage, gaps, and optimization strategies.
## This approach empowers operators to:
### 🔹 Enhance coverage prediction.
### 🔹 Improve planning accuracy.
### 🔹 Leverage legacy infrastructure alongside new technologies.
Digital Twins bridge the gap between theoretical planning and real-world deployment, driving cost-effective, high-performance networks for the future.
